A gui screenshot program written in go

## Why I'm making this

I am new to software development and I want to learn stuff about Go and C, I just came up for this as a way for me to learn go and learn programming as a whole.

This program probably sucks and I am most likely going to abandon it by the time the program is in *working* condition. 

## Bug reports & Pull requests 
Feel free to submit a pull request and take a look, I will most likely not accept them unless theres some feature I think is good.

# This program is WIP
